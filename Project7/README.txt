Create a program that simulates playing the game "Pig" with an AI. Deals with multiple classes:

- Die: rolls random value, can also be fed a value to roll
- Player: can use Die, has a score/total score 
- Board: Keeps track of player's scores, determines when game is won and who wins
- Pig: Manages flow of the game and how the Human/Computer can play

Key Concepts: Object Oriented Programming with multiple complex classes
